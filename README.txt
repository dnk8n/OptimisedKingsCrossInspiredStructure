The file of interest is kc.m, run it in Matlab (perhaps Octave will also work?)

I am investigating how the Kings Cross structure could be optimised to reduce costs of materials and construction. This includes selecting number of beam and truss elelments, how they are arranged and what they are made up of. I want to use eurocodes together with finite element analysis to ensure a practical structure while using genetic algorithms to minimise the overall cost. At the moment I only have the geometry with random inputs, thus giving a random Kings Cross-like structure at every execution. I have not yet modelled how the structure connects to the ground (it's trickier due to the change in symmetry). Please leave comments on how you think I could have done better and what you reckon I should do to move forward. Also, bear in mind that I am brand new to Matlab language so my code might not be very readable or efficient. Thanks for having a look though! :)
